# Scheduler

This project required the building of a work schedule app.
By using moment.js I was able to use accurate dates for the app.
With jquery and bootstrap and awesome I was able leverage there libraries to make the webpage look good and run easily.

The challenge requires the data entered to be stored in local storage so that it remains on the page when refreshed.

This was my biggest challenge. It took me several hours and help from a tutor find what piece of code I was missing.
